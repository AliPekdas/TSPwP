Goal is to find a route visiting a subset of cities that minimizes the sum of the total travel distance plus penalties for each city not visited.
Input format: A penalty value applied for each skipped city. A list of n cities, each with an ID and 2D coordinates (x, y).
Output format: The total cost, which is the sum of the tour length plus penalties for unvisited cities and number of visited cities. An ordered tour visiting some subset of the cities exactly once and returning to the start.
